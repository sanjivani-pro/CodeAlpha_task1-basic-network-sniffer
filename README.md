# CodeAlpha_task1-basic-network-sniffer
Basic Network Packet Sniffer:This repository contains the work completed during my Cyber Security Internship at CodeAlpha. Throughout the internship, I engaged in hands-on tasks that enhanced my practical understanding of network security, ethical hacking, and Python-based security tool development. In Task 1, I developed a basic network packet sniffer using Python and Scapy, capable of capturing real-time network traffic. The tool extracts essential information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol types (TCP, UDP, ICMP), packet lengths, and payload data. This project gave me valuable insight into how data flows across networks and how different protocols operate at various layers. It was a key step in applying theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios. As a passionate Cyber Security student with a strong programming background in C, C++, and Python, Iâ€™m constantly exploring ethical hacking techniques and security automation through practical, project-based learning. This internship has been a meaningful step forward in my journey toward a career in cybersecurity.
